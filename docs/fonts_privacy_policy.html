  <h2>IMPORTANT PRIVACY INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>
    We automatically collect from your device language settings, IP address,
    time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system,
    Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, Facebook ID, and
    other unique identifiers (such as IDFA and AAID). We need this data to

          We value your right to influence the ads that you see, thus we are

          We use <strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong> together with
          <strong>Facebook Custom Audience</strong>, which allows us to choose
          audiences that will see our ads on Facebook or other Facebook’s
          products (for example, Instagram). Through Facebook Custom Audience we
          may create a list of users with certain sets of data, such as an IDFA,
          choose users that have completed certain actions in the Service (for
          example, installed the App). As a result, we may ask Facebook to show
          some ads to a particular list of users. As a result, more of our ads
          may show up while you are using Facebook or other Facebook’s products
          (for example, Instagram). You may learn how to opt out of advertising

          <strong>Google Ads</strong> is an ad delivery service provided by
          Google that can deliver ads to users. In particular, Google allows us
          to tailor the ads in a way that they will appear, for example, only to
          users that have conducted certain actions with our App (for example,
          show our ads to users who have made a purchase). Some other examples
          of events that may be used for tailoring ads include, in particular,
          installing our App. Google allows its users to

          delivery service provided by Snapchat that can link the activity of
          some users of our App with the Snapchat advertising network and show
