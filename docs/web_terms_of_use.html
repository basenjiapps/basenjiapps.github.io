  </ul> <br><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">8. DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTIES</strong> <br> THE WEBSITE, CONTENT AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE
  SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". THE WEBSITE, CONTENT AND
  OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY AND
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF
  PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. THE
  COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (I)
  THE SERVICE, CONTENT OR OTHER INFORMATION WILL BE TIMELY, ACCURATE, RELIABLE
  OR <br> CORRECT; (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY
  PARTICULAR TIME OR PLACE; (III) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (IV)

  IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE
  OF, THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE WEBSITE, CONTENT AND USER CONTENT), AND THIRD

  RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTING SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING

  HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO YOU FOR ANY
  AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE, CONTENT OR SERVICE IS
  LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO THE COMPANY FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF
  THE SERVICE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL
  ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE TERMS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND YOU. <br>9.3. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR
  INCIDENTAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY
  NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM
  JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.<br> <br><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">10.
    INDEMNITY</strong> <br> You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its
  successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, any related companies, its suppliers,
  licensors and partners, and the officers, directors, employees, agents and
  representatives of each of them harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees,
  from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (i)
  your use of the Service, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of
  these Terms. The Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the
  exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to
  indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You
  agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of the
  Company. The Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such
  claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it. <br> <br><strong
    data-redactor-tag="strong">11. INTERNATIONAL USE</strong> <br> The Company
  makes no representation that the Service is accessible, appropriate or legally
  available for use in your jurisdiction, and accessing and using the Service is
  prohibited from territories where doing so would be illegal. You access the
  Service at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local
  laws.<br> <br> <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">12. MANDATORY BINDING
    ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong> <br> 12.1. PLEASE READ THIS
  ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE
  PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE
  MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU
  ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE
  RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE
  RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. <br> 12.2. YOU AGREE
  THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
  PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
  REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
  CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
  REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. <br> 12.3. YOU AND THE COMPANY, AND EACH
  OF ITS RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES,
  PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION
  (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE
  FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND
  CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR THE
  PRIVACY POLICY, UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE
  EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION. <br> 12.4. Arbitration is
  more informal way to settle disputes than a lawsuit in court. A neutral
  arbitrator instead of a judge or jury is used in arbitration, which allows for
  more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
  courts. The same damages and relief that a court can award can be awarded by
  arbitrators. Please see more information about arbitration at <a
    href="http://www.adr.org" data-verified="redactor">http://www.adr.org</a>.
  <br> 12.5. A party which intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
  other a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice") by an international
  courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in the absence of a mailing address
  provided by you to us, via any other method available to us, including via
  e-mail. The Notice to the Company must be addressed to: Florinis 7, Greg
  Tower, 2nd Floor, 1065, Nicosia, Cyprus (as applicable, <br> the "Arbitration
  Notice Address"). The Notice shall (i) describe the basis and nature of the
  claim or dispute; and (ii) set the specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If
  you and the Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30
  days after the Notice is received, then you or we may commence an arbitration
  proceeding as set forth below or file an individual claim in small claims
  court. <br> 12.6. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL
  EXCLUSIVELY ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL
  ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED
  DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THESE TERMS. <br> 12.7. If you commence
  arbitration against us, you are required to provide a second Notice to the
  Company at the Arbitration Notice Address within seven (7) days of arbitration
  commencement. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at <a
    href="http://www.adr.org" data-verified="redactor">http://www.adr.org</a>
  Unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad
  faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing
  fee, if you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration
  against us, then we will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of
  the filing fee upon our receipt of the second Notice at the Arbitration Notice
  Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing
  payment of the filing fee. <br> 12.8. The arbitration shall be conducted
  exclusively in English. A single, independent and impartial arbitrator with
  his or her primary place of business in Alexandria, Virginia (if you are from
  the United States) or in Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus (if you are not from the
  United States) will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.
  You and the Company agree to comply with the following rules, which are
  intended to streamline the arbitration process and reduce the costs and
  burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be
  solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the
  party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any
  personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
  agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the
  arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br>
  12.9. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE
  THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
  ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
  PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU <br>
  AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE
  PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
  REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION IS
  FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION
  SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. <br> 12.10. The arbitrator shall have the
  exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
  interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of
  these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The
  arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether
  this arbitration clause can be enforced against a non-party to this agreement
  and whether a non-party to these Terms can enforce its provision against you
  or us. <br> 12.11. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will
  issue his or her final, confidential decision within 120 days from the date
  the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an
  additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause and in the interests of
  justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and
  confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed,
  except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The
  award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement
  setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator
  shall apply the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to its
  conflicts of laws principles in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge
  that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving
  interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") will
  govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this
  Section 12. Any award rendered shall be final, subject to appeal under the
  FAA. <br> 12.12. The abovestated provisions of this Section 12 shall not apply
  to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such
  party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property. For
  the avoidance of doubt, you agree that, in the event the Company or a third
  party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not
  entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against us, and your
  only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of
  liability set forth in these Terms. <br> 12.13. You and we agree that,
  notwithstanding any other rights a party may have at law or in equity, any
  claim arising out of or related to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy)
  or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must be initiated with
  the AAA or filed in the respective court within one (1) year after the claim
  accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently and forever barred.
  This one (1) year period includes the thirty (30) day pre-dispute procedure
