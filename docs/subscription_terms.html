  <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">1. Trial</strong><br />
  We may offer a free or a paid trial subscription for service. Unless you
  cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial, you will be
  automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen
  subscription period. <br />
  <br />
  <strong data-redactor-tag="strong"><br />2. Subscription</strong><br />
  The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each week,
  month, 6 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the option selected by you
  at the time of purchase) until you cancel. <br />
  <br />
  <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">3. Payment method</strong>
  <br />
  Payment will be charged to the payment method you submitted at the time of
  purchase at confirmation of purchase. You authorize us to charge the
  applicable fees to the payment method that you submit. <br />
  <br />
  <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">4. Cancellation</strong>
  <br />
  Canceling your subscription means that the automatic renewal will be disabled,
  but you will still have access to all your subscription features for the
  remaining time of then-current period. Note that deleting the app does not
  cancel your subscriptions. <br />

  through your Apple ID account settings. To avoid being charged, cancel the

  end of the trial or then-current subscription period. You alone can manage
  your subscriptions. Learn more about managing subscriptions (and how to cancel
  them) on
