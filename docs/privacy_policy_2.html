  use <strong>Firebase Remote Config</strong>. Firebase Remote Config is an A/B
  testing and configuration service provided by Google, which also enables us to
  tailor the content that our Service’s users see (for example, it allows us to
  show different onboarding screens to different users). <a

  We value your right to influence the ads that you see, thus we are letting you

  you to control your ad preferences. <br />
  We use <strong>Facebook pixel</strong> on the Service. Facebook pixel is a
  code placed on the Service collecting data that helps us track conversions
  from Facebook ads, build targeted audience and remarket to people who have
  taken some action on the Service (for example, made a purchase). <br />
  We use <strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong> together with
  <strong>Facebook Custom Audience</strong>, which allows us to choose audiences
  that will see our ads on Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example,
  Instagram). Through Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list of users
  with certain sets of data, such as an IDFA, choose users that have completed
  certain actions in the Service (for example, visited certain sections of the
  Service). As a result, we may ask Facebook to show some ads to a particular
  list of users. As a result, more of our ads may show up while you are using
  Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). You may learn
  how to opt out of advertising provided to you through Facebook Custom Audience
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">here</a>. <br />

  >. <br />
  <strong>Google Ads</strong> is an ad delivery service provided by Google that
  can deliver ads to users. In particular, Google allows us to tailor the ads in
  a way that they will appear, for example, only to users that have conducted
  certain actions with our Service (for example, show our ads to users who have
  made a purchase). Some other examples of events that may be used for tailoring
  ads include, in particular, visiting our Website. Google allows its users to
  <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=ru"
    >opt out of Google’s personalized ads</a
  >
  and to
  <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"
    >prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics</a
  >. <br />
  We also use <strong>Snapchat Advertising Platform</strong> together
  with <strong>Snapchat Audience Based Match</strong>, which is an ad delivery
  service provided by Snapchat that can link the activity of some users of our
  Service with the Snapchat advertising network and show some of our ads to
  them. As a result, you may see more of ads on Snapchat in case you use our
  Service. Snapchat allows you to <a

    >TikTok’s Privacy Policy</a
  >.<br />
  We also use <strong>Twitter Ads</strong> provided by Twitter to deliver
  advertising. Twitter Ads allows us to choose specific audiences based on
  geographic areas or user’s interests. As a result, we may ask Twitter to
  deliver our ads to certain list of users. Twitter allows you
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads"
    >to opt-out its internet-based advertising</a
  >. <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. <br />

  <strong>3.8. To process your payments</strong><br />
  We provide paid products and/or services within the Service. For this purpose,
  we use third-party services for payment processing (for example, payment
  processors). As a result of this processing, you will be able to make a
  payment and we will be notified that the payment has been made. <br />

    >12. DATA RETENTION
  </strong>
  <br />
  We will store your personal data for as long as it is reasonably necessary for

    >13. HOW “DO NOT TRACK” REQUESTS ARE HANDLED
  </strong>
  <br />
  Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a
  DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a
  signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT
  preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's
  preferences.<br />
  We currently do not support “Do Not Track” requests because no DNT standard
  has been adopted.<br />
  Our third-party services may collect information about you and your online
  activities over time and across our Services and other online properties.
  These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT
  settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT
  settings. To determine whether any of the third-party services honor the “Do
  Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies. <br />
