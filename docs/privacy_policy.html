    In order to use the service, we will ask you to enter your name and email.
    We will also automatically collect from your device language settings, IP
    address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating
    system, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, Facebook ID,

    provide our services, analyze how our customers use the service and to
    measure ads.

    such third parties. This enables us to (1) analyze different interactions
    (how often users make purchases); (2) serve and measure ads (and show them
    only to a particular group of users, for example, only to those, who have
    made a purchase).

          We use Facebook Ads Manager together with Facebook Custom Audience,
          which allows us to choose audiences that will see our ads on Facebook
          or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). Through
          Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list of users with certain
          sets of data, such as an IDFA, choose users that have completed
          certain actions in the Service (for example, visited certain sections
          of the Service). As a result, we may ask Facebook to show some ads to
          a particular list of users. As a result, more of our ads may show up
          while you are using Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for
          example, Instagram). You may learn how to opt out of advertising

  <h2 id="section-12">12. DATA RETENTION</h2>
  <p>
    We will store your personal data for as long as it is reasonably necessary
    for achieving the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy (including

    data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,

  </p>

  <h2 id="section-13">13. HOW “DO NOT TRACK” REQUESTS ARE HANDLED</h2>

  <p>
    Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a
    DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a
    signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT
    preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your
    browser's preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    We currently do not support “Do Not Track” requests because no DNT standard
    has been adopted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our third-party services may collect information about you and your online
    activities over time and across our Services and other online properties.
    These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to
    DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to
    honor DNT settings. To determine whether any of the third-party services
    honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section-14">14. CONTACT US</h2>

    You may contact us at any time for details regarding this Privacy Policy and
