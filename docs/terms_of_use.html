    EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE TERMS

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>9.3</strong> SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR
    EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
    LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER
    LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
  </p>

  <strong>10. INDEMNITY</strong>

  <p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its successors, subsidiaries,
    affiliates, any related companies, its suppliers, licensors and partners,
    and the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of each
    of them harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or
    demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) your use of the
    Service, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms. The
    Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense
    and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you
    agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle
    any matter without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company
    will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or
    proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
  </p>

  <strong>11. INTERNATIONAL USE </strong>

  <p>
    The Company makes no representation that the Service is accessible,
    appropriate or legally available for use in your jurisdiction, and accessing
    and using the Service is prohibited from territories where doing so would be
    illegal. You access the Service at your own initiative and are responsible
    for compliance with local laws.
  </p>

  <strong>12. MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER </strong>

  <p>
    <strong>12.1</strong> PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO
    UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY
    CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND
    BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE
    WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU
    WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED
    OR MAY NOT EXIST.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.12</strong> YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR
    INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS
    MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER
    AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR
    OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.3</strong> YOU AND THE COMPANY, AND EACH OF ITS RESPECTIVE
    AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN
    INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS
    THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE
    RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING
    OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR THE PRIVACY POLICY,
    UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF
    ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.4</strong> Arbitration is more informal way to settle disputes
    than a lawsuit in court. A neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury is
    used in arbitration, which allows for more limited discovery than in court,
    and is subject to very limited review by courts. The same damages and relief
    that a court can award can be awarded by arbitrators. Please see more
    information about arbitration at
    <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.5</strong> A party which intends to seek arbitration must first
    send to the other a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice") by an
    international courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in the absence of a
    mailing address provided by you to us, via any other method available to us,
    including via e-mail. The Notice to the Company must be addressed to:
    Florinis 7, Greg Tower, 2nd Floor, 1065, Nicosia, Cyprus (as applicable, the
    "Arbitration Notice Address"). The Notice shall (i) describe the basis and
    nature of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set the specific relief sought (the
    "Demand"). If you and the Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the
    claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or we may
    commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file an individual
    claim in small claims court.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.6</strong> THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL
    EXCLUSIVELY ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL
    ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED
    DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THESE TERMS.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.7</strong> If you commence arbitration against us, you are
    required to provide a second Notice to the Company at the Arbitration Notice
    Address within seven (7) days of arbitration commencement. The Rules and AAA
    forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. Unless your Demand is
    equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you
    are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee, if you are
    required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against us, then we
    will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee
    upon our receipt of the second Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that
    you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of
    the filing fee.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.8</strong> The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in
    English. A single, independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her
    primary place of business in Alexandria, Virginia (if you are from the
    United States) or in Nicosia, Cyprus (if you are not from the United States)
    will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and the
    Company agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to
    streamline the arbitration process and reduce the costs and burdens on the
    parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based
    on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party
    initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any
    personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
    agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the
    arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.10</strong> The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole
    authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
    construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms,
    Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have
    the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration
    clause can be enforced against a non-party to this agreement and whether a
    non-party to these Terms can enforce its provision against you or us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.11</strong> Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator
    will issue his or her final, confidential decision within 120 days from the
    date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit
    for an additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause and in the interests
    of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and
    confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed,
    except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.
    The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement
    setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator
    shall apply the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to its
    conflicts of laws principles in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge
    that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction
    involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act
    ("FAA") will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings
    pursuant to this Section. Any award rendered shall be final, subject to
    appeal under the FAA.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.12</strong> The abovestated provisions of this Section shall not
    apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect
    such party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual
    property. For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that, in the event the
    Company or a third party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any,
    caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable
    relief against us, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages,
    subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.13</strong> You and we agree that, notwithstanding any other
    rights a party may have at law or in equity, any claim arising out of or
    related to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service,
    excluding a claim for indemnification, must be initiated with the AAA or
    filed in small claims court in Alexandria, Virginia within one (1) year
    after the claim accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently and
    forever barred. This one (1) year period includes the thirty (30) day
    pre-dispute procedure set forth in sub-clause 12.5 above.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.14</strong> All claims you bring against the Company must be
    resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought
    contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you
    file a claim contrary to this Section, the Company may recover attorneys'
    fees and reimbursement of its costs, provided that the Company has notified
    you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you fail to promptly
    withdraw such claim.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.15</strong> In the event that we make any material change to this
    arbitration provision (other than a change to our Arbitration Notice
    Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to our
    Arbitration Notice Address within thirty (30) days of the change, in which
    case you shall terminate your use of the Service immediately, and this
    Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will
    survive the termination of these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>12.16</strong>If only sub-clause 12.9 above or the entirety of this
    Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will
    be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive
    jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action
    arising out of or related to this Agreement.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.17</strong> YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO
    LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO
    BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND
    AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING,
    FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>12.18</strong> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION
    PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST USE, OR
    ATTEMPT TO USE, THE SERVICE BY WRITING TO support@bsnj.co OR TO THE
    ARBITRATION NOTICE ADDRESS. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST
    SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE OPTING OUT AND CONTAINING ENOUGH DETAILS
    ABOUT YOU FOR US TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS. IF MORE
    THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS HAVE PASSED, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT OUT OF THIS
    PROVISION AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET
    FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
